<h2 id="what-is-zep">What is ZEP?</h2>

<p>ZEP stands for Zarr Enhancement Proposal. A ZEP is a design document providing
information to the Zarr community, describing a modification or enhancement of
the Zarr specification, a new feature for its processes or environment.
The ZEP should provide specific proposed changes to the Zarr specification and
a narrative rationale for the specification changes.</p>

<p>We intend ZEPs to be the primary mechanism for evolving the spec, collecting
community input on major issues and documenting the design decision that has
gone into Zarr. In addition, the ZEP author is responsible for building
consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.</p>

<p>Because the ZEPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their
revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.</p>

<p>WHERE:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Developers refer to contributors and maintainers of the project</li>
  <li>User(s) refers to an individual or group of individuals or the broader
community using the project in any way.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="zep-audience">ZEP audience</h2>

<p>The typical primary audience for ZEPs is the developers working on Zarr and its
various implementations, the Zarr steering council as well as the Zarr
community.</p>

<p>The broader Zarr community may also choose to use the process to document
expected feature additions and to manage complex design coordination problems
that require collaboration across multiple projects.</p>

<h2 id="zep-types">ZEP types</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Specification ZEP</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Specification ZEPs deal with the changes related to <a href="https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/">Zarr Specifications</a>.
The SPEC ZEP (abbreviation of Specification ZEP) for now introduces changes in
the core specification of Zarr. The changes related to core specification follow a
strict and thorough review process and should be adopted by everyone in the
Zarr community.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Core protocol ZEP</li>
</ul>

<p>Describes a ZEP which involves changes in the core specification of Zarr. Core
protocol ZEPs (commonly known as Core ZEPs) are a part of SPEC ZEPs and apply to
<a href="https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/">Zarr Specifications</a> and its various implementations under the
<a href="https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr_implementations">zarr_implementations</a> GitHub repo. The core protocol ZEPs should be adopted by
every implementation of Zarr and, in general, the overall Zarr community. Core
ZEPs must go through a thorough review process, including involvement,
discussion, and voting from the author of the proposed ZEP, Zarr Steering
Council, author(s) of various Zarr implementations, and open-source
projects/research groups using Zarr and the general Zarr community. The general
advice is that everyone should be made aware of changes introduced by core
ZEPs. Core protocol ZEPs require community consensus, and developers or users
are typically not free to ignore them.</p>

<p>Note: Currently, Specification ZEPs only deal with the core specification of Zarr.
The scope of SPEC ZEPs will be extended in the future.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Informational ZEP</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Describes a ZEP design issue or provides general guidelines or information to
the Zarr community but does not propose a new feature. Informational ZEPs do
not necessarily represent Zarr community consensus or recommendation, so users
and implementers are free to ignore informational ZEPS or follow their advice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Process ZEP</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Describes a new process around Zarr and its implementations or proposes a
change to (or an event in) a process. They may propose an implementation, but
not to the Zarr‚Äôs specification or its implementations; they require community
consensus; unlike informational ZEPs, they are more than recommendations, and 
developers or users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include 
procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to
the tools or environment used in Zarr‚Äôs specification development. Any meta-ZEP
is also considered a Process ZEP.</p>

<h2 id="zep-workflow">ZEP Workflow</h2>

<p>The ZEP process begins with a new idea for Zarr. It is highly recommended that
a single ZEP contain a single key proposal or new idea. Small enhancements or
patches often don‚Äôt need a ZEP and can be injected into the Zarr development
workflow with a pull request to the Zarr ZEP repo. The more focused the ZEP,
the more successful it tends to be. If in doubt, split your ZEP into several
well-focused ones.</p>

<p>Each ZEP must have a champion ‚Äì someone who writes the ZEP using the style and
format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate forums,
and attempts to build community consensus around the idea. The ZEP champion
(a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to ascertain whether the idea is suitable
for a ZEP. Posting to <a href="https://gitter.im/zarr-developers/community">Gitter</a> or creating an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/zarr-developers/community">community</a> repository
or posting on the organization <a href="https://github.com/orgs/zarr-developers/discussions">discussions</a> are the best ways to go about doing this.</p>

<p>The ZEP champion is the lead author of the ZEP. A ZEP should have a lead
author and can have multiple co-author(s).</p>

<p>Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a ZEP is meant to save
the potential author time. Asking the Zarr community first if an idea is
original helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is
guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussion. It also helps to make sure
the idea applies to the entire community and not just the author. Just because
an idea sounds good to the author does not mean it will work for most people.</p>

<p>Once the champion has asked the Zarr community whether an idea has any chance
of acceptance, a draft ZEP should be presented to the appropriate venue
mentioned below. This allows the author to flesh out the draft ZEP to make it
properly formatted, of high quality, and address initial concerns about the
proposal.</p>

<p>After the PR for the ZEP is in place, a post should be made on the GitHub
organisation <a href="https://github.com/orgs/zarr-developers/discussions">discussions</a>, containing the sections up to ‚ÄúBackward
compatibility‚Äù to limit discussion there to usage and impact. Discussion on the
pull request will have a broader scope, including details of implementation.</p>

<p>Spec ZEPs consist of two parts, a PR to the <a href="https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs">zarr-specs</a> repository containing
changes to the spec and a narrative document explaining the need, importance and
use-case for the change. It is also highly recommended that the specification
ZEP be accompanied by an implementation PR in at least one of the repositories
represented in the <a href="https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr_implementations">zarr_implementations</a>.</p>

<h3 id="submitting-a-zep">Submitting a ZEP</h3>

<p>For Spec ZEPs, the proposal should be submitted as a draft ZEP via two GitHub
pull requests, one to the zarr-developers/zep repo and the other to the
<a href="https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs">zarr-specs</a> repository.</p>

<p>The first PR should contain the narrative text of the ZEP and should be
submitted in the zep repository with the name <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zep-&lt;n&gt;.rst</code> where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;n&gt;</code> is an
appropriately assigned four-digit number. The draft ZEP must use the <a href="../template/template.md">ZEP X -
Template and Instructions</a> file.</p>

<p>The second PR should contain actual changes and should be submitted in the
<a href="https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs">zarr-specs</a> repository. That PR repository should mention the assigned
four-digit ZEP number from the zarr-developers/zep repository.</p>

<p>For ZEPs other than spec, the proposal should be submitted as a draft ZEP via a
GitHub pull request to the zarr-developers/zep repository with the name
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zep-&lt;n&gt;.rst</code> where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;n&gt;</code> is an appropriately assigned four-digit number (e.g.,
zep-0000.rst). The draft ZEP must use the
<a href="../template/template.md">ZEP X - Template and Instructions</a> file.</p>

<p>A few points to consider while submitting your ZEP:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It should sound complete. The ideas must make technical sense.</li>
  <li>The title should accurately describe the content.</li>
  <li>The ZEP‚Äôs language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure etc.) and code style should be correct and conformant.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="../../GOVERNANCE.md#zarr-steering-council">Zarr Steering Council</a>
and the Zarr Implementations Council will not unreasonably deny publication of
a ZEP. Reasons for denying ZEP include duplication of effort, being technically
unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing backwards compatibility,
or not taking care of Zarr <a href="https://github.com/zarr-developers/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">CODE OF CONDUCT</a>.</p>

<h3 id="discussing-a-zep">Discussing a ZEP</h3>

<p>As soon as the draft ZEP is committed to the ZEP repository, the author(s)
should create a discussion thread for the ZEP to provide a central place to
discuss and review its contents. The ZEP author(s) may select the GitHub
discussion feature in the organisation <a href="https://github.com/orgs/zarr-developers/discussions">discussions</a> or the ZEP repository and
similarly use the discussion feature in the <a href="https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs">zarr-specs</a> repository for
specification ZEPs. Alternatively, the author(s) may open a new issue in the
Zarr <a href="https://github.com/zarr-developers/community">community</a> repository or start the discussion in the Zarr <a href="https://gitter.im/zarr-developers/community">Gitter</a> channel.
The discussion regarding the ZEP should follow Zarr‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/zarr-developers/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">CODE OF CONDUCT</a> at all
times.</p>

<p>ZEP authors are responsible for collecting community feedback on a ZEP.
However, to avoid long-winded and open-ended discussions, strategies such as
soliciting private or more narrowly-tailored feedback in the early design
phase, collaborating with other community members with expertise in the ZEP‚Äôs
subject matter, and picking appropriately-specialised discussion for the ZEP‚Äôs
topic should be considered. ZEP authors should use their discretion here.</p>

<p>Once the ZEP is committed to the ZEP repository, substantive issues should
generally be discussed on the canonical public thread, as opposed to private
channels or unrelated venues. This ensures everyone can follow and contribute,
avoids fragmenting the discussion, and makes sure it is fully considered as
part of the ZEP review process. Comments, support, concerns and other feedback
on this designated thread are a critical part when reviewing the ZEP.</p>

<h3 id="review-and-resolution">Review and Resolution</h3>

<p>The possible paths of the status of ZEPs are as follows:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/flowchart.png" alt="Flowchart" /></p>

<p>All ZEPs should be created with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Draft</code> status.</p>

<p>Eventually, after the discussion, there may be a consensus that the ZEP should
be accepted - see the next section for details. At this point, the status
becomes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Accepted</code>.</p>

<p>Once a Specification ZEP has been Accepted, the second PR which was submitted in
the <a href="https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs">zarr-specs</a> repository must be merged. After that, the status will be
changed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Final</code>.</p>

<p>To allow the gathering of additional design and interface feedback before
committing to long term stability for specification change or standard library
API, ZEP may also be marked as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">‚ÄúProvisional‚Äù</code>. This is short for
‚ÄúProvisionally Accepted‚Äù and indicates that the proposal has been accepted for
inclusion in the reference implementation or storage specification, but
additional user feedback is needed before the full design can be considered
‚ÄúFinal‚Äù. Unlike regular accepted ZEPs, provisionally accepted ZEPs may still be
Rejected or Withdrawn even after the related changes have been included in a
Zarr release.</p>

<p>Wherever possible, it is considered preferable to reduce the scope of a
proposal to avoid the need to rely on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">‚ÄúProvisional‚Äù</code> status (e.g. by
deferring some features to later ZEPs), as this status can lead to version
compatibility challenges in the wider Zarr ecosystem.</p>

<p>A ZEP can also be assigned status <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Deferred</code>. The ZEP author or <a href="../../GOVERNANCE.md#zarr-steering-council">Zarr Steering
Council</a> or Zarr Implementations Council can assign the ZEP this status when no
progress is being made on the ZEP.</p>

<p>A ZEP can also be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rejected</code>. Perhaps, after all, is said and done it was not a
good idea. It is still important to have a record of this fact. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Withdrawn</code>
status is similar‚Äîit means that the ZEP author themselves has decided that the
ZEP is a bad idea, or has accepted that a competing proposal is a better
alternative.</p>

<p>When a ZEP is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Accepted</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rejected</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Withdrawn</code>, the ZEP should be updated
accordingly. In addition to updating the status field, at the very least the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Resolution</code> header should be added with a link to the relevant link of the
discussion.</p>

<p>ZEPs can also be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Superseded</code> by a different ZEP, rendering the original
obsolete. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Replaced-By</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Replaces</code> headers should be added to the
original and new ZEPs respectively. Process ZEPs may also have a status of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Active</code> if they are never meant to be completed, e.g. ZEP 0 (this ZEP).</p>

<h3 id="how-does-a-zep-become-accepted">How does a ZEP become accepted?</h3>

<p>A ZEP is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Accepted</code> by the consensus of all interested contributors. We need a
concrete way to tell whether the agreement has been reached.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For Core ZEPs:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We believe Core ZEPs are of utmost importance and should follow a thorough
review before acceptance. Core ZEPs introduce changes in the core
specification, which are necessary for every other implementation and everyone
in the general community to follow. The <a href="../../GOVERNANCE.md#zarr-steering-council">Zarr Steering Council</a> and
Implementations Council closely review the Core ZEPs, while the author(s) should
simultaneously engage the community in their ZEP at several discussion forums
mentioned previously. The ZSC and ZIC would take community consensus into account
while taking the final decision on the Core ZEPs. Author(s) should ensure that
the involvement and discussion form the consensus on the ZEP from the author of
various Zarr implementations, open-source projects/research groups using Zarr,
the general Zarr community, and anyone else they, ZSC and ZIC think should be
included in the discussions. The Core ZEPs are accepted by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Unanimous approval of the Zarr Steering Council</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Majority approval of the Zarr Implementations Council</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Approval indicates that implementation plans to implement the new spec
features. Not all implementations must implement all features, but a majority is
required.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>No vetos from the Zarr Implementations Council</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Each implementation has the right to veto a ZEP if it would cause severe
problems for that implementation.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read more about <a href="https://github.com/zarr-developers/governance/pull/17">Zarr Implementation Council</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For other ZEPs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For ZEPs, other than specifications, the author(s) must form a consensus around
their proposal. They may refer to <a href="#discussing-a-zep">Discussing a ZEP</a> section to pick an avenue
for discussion and engaging the community.</p>

<p>When you think ZEP is ready to accept, create a new discussion in <a href="https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs">zarr-specs</a>
for Specifications ZEPs using ‚ÄòGeneral‚Äô and in zarr-developers/zep for other
ZEPs and as the category with a subject like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Proposal to accept ZEP &lt;number&gt;: &lt;title&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the body of your discussion, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Link to the latest version of ZEP,</li>
  <li>Briefly describe any major points of contention and how they were resolved,</li>
  <li>Include a sentence like: ‚ÄúIf there are no substantive objections within 7 days
from this post, then the ZEP will be accepted;</li>
</ul>

<p>After you create the discussion, you should make sure to link the newly created
thread in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Discussion</code> section of the ZEP, so that people can find it later.</p>

<p>Generally, the ZEP author will be the one to create this post, but anyone can
do it ‚Äì the important thing is to make sure that everyone knows when a ZEP is
on the verge of acceptance, and give them a final chance to respond. If
there‚Äôs some special reason to extend this final comment period beyond
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">7 days</code>, then that‚Äôs fine, just say so in the post. You shouldn‚Äôt do less
than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">7 days</code>, because sometimes people are travelling or similar and need
some time to respond.</p>

<p>There may be a case that a ZEP didn‚Äôt attract needed attention towards it, the
engagement from the community is low, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">7 days</code> pass by. In this case,
the author(s) of the ZEP must make necessary efforts to spread the word about
the ZEP through <a href="https://gitter.im/zarr-developers/community">Gitter</a> or using the organisation <a href="https://github.com/orgs/zarr-developers/discussions">discussions</a> feature of
GitHub or, if needed, creating an additional PR in the <a href="https://github.com/zarr-developers/community">community</a> repository.
In addition, the author(s) should get in touch with the <a href="../../GOVERNANCE.md#zarr-steering-council">Zarr Steering Council</a>
to prevent the case that the ZEP was accepted due to less participation from the
community.</p>

<p>If all the above options are exhausted by the author(s), then it‚Äôs the
responsibility of the <a href="../../GOVERNANCE.md#zarr-steering-council">Zarr Steering Council</a> to take the final decision on the
ZEP.</p>

<p>In general, the goal is to make sure that the community has consensus, not
provide a rigid policy for people to try to game. When in doubt, err on the
side of asking for more feedback and looking for opportunities to compromise.</p>

<p>If the final comment period passes without any substantive objections, then the
ZEP can officially be marked <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Accepted</code>. You should create a follow-up
discussion thread in zarr-developers/zep repository notifying everyone
(celebratory emoji optional but encouraged üéâ‚ú®), and then update the ZEP by
setting its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:Status:</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Accepted</code>, and it‚Äôs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:Resolution:</code> header to a link
to your follow-up discussion thread.</p>

<p>If there are substantive objections, then the ZEP remains in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Draft</code> state,
discussion continues as normal, and it can be proposed for acceptance again
later once the objections are resolved.</p>

<p>In unusual cases, the <a href="../../GOVERNANCE.md#zarr-steering-council">Zarr Steering Council</a> may be asked to decide whether a
controversial ZEP is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Accepted</code>.</p>

<h3 id="maintenance">Maintenance</h3>

<p>In general, SPEC ZEPs are no longer modified after they have reached the Final
state. The changes made to the Zarr‚Äôs core specification in the
<a href="https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs">zarr-specs</a> repository are considered the ultimate reference. However,
finalised SPEC ZEPS may be updated with minor changes as needed.</p>

<p>Process ZEPs may be updated over time to reflect changes to development
practices and other details. The precise process followed in these cases will
depend on the nature and purpose of the ZEP being updated.</p>

<h2 id="zep-format">ZEP Format</h2>

<p>ZEPs are UTF-8 encoded text files using the
<a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">reStructureText</a> format. Please see
the <a href="../template/template.md">ZEP X - Template and Instructions</a> file and the
<a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html">reStructuredTextPrimer</a> for
more information.</p>

<h3 id="header-preamble">Header Preamble</h3>
