<p><a href="https://zarr.dev/" class="btn btn-primary fs-5 mb-4 mb-md-0 mr-2">Propose a new ZEP</a>

<hr />

<p>ZEP stands for Zarr Enhancement Proposal. A ZEP is a design document providing
information to the Zarr community, describing a modification or enhancement of
the <a href="https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Zarr specifications</a>, a new
feature for its processes or environment. The ZEP should provide specific proposed
changes to the Zarr specification and a narrative rationale for the specification
changes.</p>

<p>We intend ZEPs to be the primary mechanism for evolving the spec, collecting
community input on major issues and documenting the design decision that has
gone into Zarr.</p>
